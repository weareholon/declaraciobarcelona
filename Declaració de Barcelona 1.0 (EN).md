# Draft of the declaration emerging from the Cultivation group, in May 2025. Version machine translated from catalan.

## ** Preamble **

The Barcelona Declaration for Cultural Rights responds to a global context of worsening climate and social crises, and of growing tension also due to changes in the world order of powers between nations. In this transition process full of ambiguity, the key role of culture in advancing visions of the future on the disputed present is becoming evident.

One way to explain the disputed present is through cultural forms promoting human and planetary rights and through cultural forms promoting a reaction towards normative frameworks. This declaration recognizes the profound crisis of the normative frameworks that emerged from the Second World War, both for those who criticize their content and for those who criticize that human rights and democracy continue to be used rhetorically to perpetuate the worst atrocities. Therefore, building on cultural examples that overcome nihilism and the struggles of the last against the penultimate, the Barcelona Declaration for Cultural Rights aims to highlight that there is always a cultural dimension in the exercise and defense of any human and planetary right, and that cultural practices promote can promote worthy rights in accordance with human rights.

Below we present particularly active areas where we consider that the promotion or erosion of human and planetary rights is being contested, and the forms that cultural practices take in each specific area.

## **Diversities**

Cultural practices and everything that surrounds them promote diversity as the recognition of the plurality of people and cultures in today's societies, and respect for their rights and freedoms. Their recognition is the foundation of law and equity, to avoid segregation and discrimination. This recognition is manifested in ethnic-racial, religious and spiritual, identity-related, sex-gender, physical and mental, ideological and intellectual, linguistic diversities, including the consideration of original peoples, both on an individual and collective scale.

Cultural practices that recognize and enrich diversity have the capacity to create mechanisms of balance and transformation that guarantee the active participation of the subjects representing this plurality. These practices and the cultural life they foster preserve cultural biodiversity, and it is from this richness that we can build open, living and symbolic cultural imaginaries capable of thinking about the future in common.

## **Just ecological transition**

Cultural practices foster collective imaginaries and meanings that are key to addressing just ecological transition. In the face of the climate and ecosocial crisis, cultural practices promote a relationship with the environment based on ecological and social justice, building frameworks to rethink production and consumption systems from respect for planetary limits and interdependence with the natural world. At the same time, they reinforce rootedness in the territory and the sense of belonging, strengthening ties with the place and its communities.

## **Commons and culture**

Cultural practices promote social justice through the recognition of the right to cultural practices and the promotion of community action. This ensures that citizens can develop their creative capacities and collective cultural identities through shared spaces, resources and knowledge. Projects where culture is a right exercised by everyone and is shared as a collective heritage are fundamental to rooting culture in our towns and cities.
