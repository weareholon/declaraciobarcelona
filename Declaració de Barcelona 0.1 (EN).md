# Draft of the declaration emerging from the Seed Group, in February 2025.

# Diversities
Culture must promote the recognition of diversity as a foundation of law and equity, paying special attention to avoiding segregation and discrimination.
Based on this coordinate, the idea is to address diversities linked to ethnic-racial, religious-spiritual, identity issues at the individual and collective levels, physical, consideration of original peoples, decoloniality, linguistic, etc.

# Memories, heritage and popular cultures
Culture must promote and stimulate the democratic construction of memory, the repair of damage and abuses caused historically, and the recognition of the role that material and intangible heritage plays in the configuration of cultural identities.
Therefore, space must be given and all forms of knowledge must be valued, and the role of heritage and popular and traditional cultures must be valued as elements of public value and a common good that constitutes different societies.

# Territorialities
Culture must recognize the influence of the territory located where culture is produced and presented. Recognizing where culture happens is also recognizing the right to happen.
Therefore, it is necessary to address the role of culture by recognizing new centralities, the protection and defense of public spaces and the diversity of socioeconomic elements between urban and rural contexts as fundamental aspects to guarantee cultural rights.

# Digital environments
Culture must promote the defense of the digital sphere as a common good.
Ensure democratic, open, safe, respectful and accessible environments while fighting against the concentration of power, data surveillance, algorithmic manipulation, hate speech and vested influence on the flow of digital information.
Therefore, it stimulates the protection and creation of free, transparent exchange tools, based on the relationship between people and that help culture and creators.

# Education and Mediation
Culture must promote access to artistic and cultural education in formal and non-formal contexts, fostering skills and knowledge as a fundamental basis for guaranteeing equal opportunities.

In this sense, it is necessary to focus on the fundamental role of cultural, literary and artistic mediation - around transversal elements such as interculturality, diversity or heritage, etc. - which forms a type of practice that falls under collective cultural actions where the action focuses on the processes of creation based on collaborative experiences from the citizen's protagonism and their idiosyncrasy and context.

# Socioeconomic innovations
Culture must include the objective of justice and sustainability in social, labor and economic terms.
This is why it is necessary to recognize the contexts of socio-economic innovation in the cultural field based on democratic experiences that guarantee both fair processes of creation and distribution and sustainable access for all citizens.

# Governances
Culture must promote forms of governance and organizational systems that must accompany them.
Therefore, it is necessary to develop spaces for participation in decision-making, innovate in management models and commit to transparency through democratic monitoring of budgets and resource distribution.

# Common goods and community culture
Culture must promote social articulation and cohesion through the recognition of the right to cultural practices and the promotion of community action.
This perspective seeks to guarantee that all citizens can develop their concerns and creative capacities and cultural identities through the provision of spaces, resources and knowledge.
Projects where culture is a right exercised by everyone and is shared as a collective heritage are fundamental to understanding the capacity of culture to take root in our towns and cities.

# Just ecological transition
Culture must contribute to responding to the challenges arising from climate change, and therefore face the transformations in production modes so that they contemplate respect for resources and the natural environment and their interrelationship with societies.
That is why attention must be paid to the social burden that is associated with it, asking for efforts from those who dispose of and accumulate the means of production and not worsening the situation of the most vulnerable areas and people on the planet.

# Creation, research and experimentation
Culture also implies the defense, protection and articulation of an essential part of art and culture: experimentation, testing, research and error in cultural production.
For this reason, the production of spaces, resources and recognition is stimulated. In this sense, it is also necessary to consider the material conditions of cultural creation and production from the perspective of cultural workers.

# Equity and social health
Culture is one of the package of areas that help develop a life in better social and material conditions.
From the perspective of culture, it is necessary to recognize all those factors that allow citizens to develop a life in dignity. This coordinate places some challenges linked to the role that culture plays throughout life (childhood, youth, maturity, old age), mental health, the right to housing, or emotional well-being, among others.

# Culture of peace
Culture must promote ideas that defend harmonious coexistence, mutual respect and the peaceful resolution of conflicts.
In this sense, they must also offer a solid argument to ensure peaceful coexistence at all levels, anti-warism and the fight against hate speech and discrimination.

# Right to culture and legal frameworks
Culture needs regulatory and legal mechanisms that ensure its existence, guaranteeing them and making them enforceable.
This coordinate seeks to assess the legal dimension of law in culture to see how it can broaden its potential based on the set of coordinates presented.
